# Bookstore-Api

Project: Online Bookstore with Microservices Architecture
Part 1: Building the Application in Java
You'll start by building a simple online bookstore using Spring Boot, which is a popular Java framework.

Key Features:
Book Service: A service to manage books (CRUD operations).
Order Service: A service to handle customer orders.
Customer Service: A service to manage customer information.
Payment Service: A service to handle payments.
Inventory Service: A service to track stock levels.
Each of these services will be independent microservices. You can build the microservices with the following:

Spring Boot for REST APIs
Hibernate and Spring Data JPA for database integration
MySQL or PostgreSQL as the database
Steps:
Set up Spring Boot: Start by setting up a basic Spring Boot project for each service.
Create REST APIs: For each service, create RESTful endpoints that will allow for interactions like:
Adding and retrieving books
Creating orders
Handling payments
Managing customer data
Database Integration: Use Spring Data JPA to persist data in a relational database.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests for your services using JUnit and Mockito.
Part 2: Dockerizing the Microservices
Once your services are functional, you can move to containerizing each microservice using Docker.

Steps:
Create Dockerfiles: For each microservice, write a Dockerfile that specifies how to build and run the service inside a container.
Build Docker Images: Use docker build to create container images for each microservice.
Test Locally: Run your microservices locally using Docker Compose to simulate multiple services running together.
Part 3: Deploying to Kubernetes
Now, you’ll integrate Kubernetes to orchestrate these microservices.

Steps:
Set up a Kubernetes Cluster:
Use a local Kubernetes solution like Minikube or use a cloud provider like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon EKS.
Create Kubernetes Manifests: Write the necessary YAML files for Kubernetes that define:
Deployments: For deploying each microservice as a pod.
Services: For exposing the microservices (both internally and externally).
ConfigMaps/Secrets: For managing configurations like database credentials.
Horizontal Scaling: Configure Kubernetes to scale up and down based on traffic (e.g., using a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).
Networking: Set up service discovery and load balancing between your microservices within the Kubernetes cluster.
CI/CD Integration: Optionally, use a CI/CD pipeline like Jenkins or GitLab CI to automatically build, test, and deploy the application to Kubernetes.
Bonus Part: Monitoring and Logging
Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
Use ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.
Skills You’ll Learn:
Java: Core concepts, REST API development, database integration.
Spring Boot: Building microservices.
Docker: Containerizing applications.
Kubernetes: Deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.
CI/CD: Automating deployment processes.
Monitoring and Logging: Setting up observability for your application.
This project provides a solid mix of learning Java, Docker, and Kubernetes, and prepares you for real-world cloud-native development.
